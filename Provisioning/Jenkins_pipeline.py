"""Provisioning/Jenkins_pipeline.py

This repository previously stored a Jenkins Declarative Pipeline (Groovy) in a file with a .py extension which
confused editors and linters. The runnable Declarative Pipeline has been added to the repository root as
`Jenkinsfile`.

If you intentionally want a pipeline copy inside `Provisioning/`, rename this file to `Jenkinsfile` (remove the
.py extension). Otherwise, configure your Jenkins job to use the root `Jenkinsfile`.

This Python module only contains this explanatory docstring so that Python tools don't report syntax errors.
"""

# End of file
    This file is intentionally a plain Python module (module docstring) so editors and linters will not report syntax

    errors.
